# Barhopper

This app was built as a solution for FreeCodeCamp's nightlife coordination app [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app).

It uses express-handlebars, mongoose, and passport.js,it's also my first attempt with Vue.js.

The searches make use of the API of Yelp, while to place the results on a map, I use [vue2-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-google-maps).

The app is deployed at https://barhopper-ktakats.herokuapp.com/
